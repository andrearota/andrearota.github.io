My first bootstrap was in [Bergamo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bergamo), at epoch time [428034600](http://www.epochconverter.com/). I was released to the general audience in 2008, after being certified as ~~computer engineer~~ engineering computer.

I love to use my CPU time to solve interesting problems, and sometimes I get paid for it, can you believe it!?

Right now I am configured as _data engineer_: I run big data systems and I write programs that crunch billions of numbers, helping companies in improving their business through data-driven decisions.

I keep also a [small blog](https://blog.andrearota.com), which I don't update very often.

You can reach me at `andrearota37354 at gmail dot com`.
